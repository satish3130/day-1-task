HTTP 1.1
	Features like CORS, keep alive(most important one)was introduced.
	More focus on gzip,minifying css/Js,caching etc.
	Initialy it uses one YCP connection.Now six TCP connections are used.
	The flaws are HOL-Head of lone blocking.Head information is repeated with every request data.
	Keep alive option enables reusing of the same TCP connectionfor multiple HTTP request.
HTTP 2
	single TCP connection.
	HTTPS request is required.It is secured.
	HPACK-Header data is separate from request data and can be zipped.
	Almost all the modern web servers support this.
	Dont worry about losing users as users using old browsers.
